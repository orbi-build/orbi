# AGENTS.md

Development contract for this repository. Every local Pi bootstrap run must
follow it before changing code.

## Read first

- Read the GitHub Issue, the configured context files, `README.md`, and the
  relevant code before touching anything.

## TDD and coverage

- TDD: write a failing test first, then the smallest implementation, then
  refactor.
- Python code keeps 100% line and branch coverage:

  ```bash
  /usr/bin/python3 -m coverage run --branch -m pytest tests/ -q
  /usr/bin/python3 -m coverage report --show-missing
  ```

## UI work

- Any UI task must drive the real running app with Playwright: real
  interaction, assertions on the changed flow, console and network error
  checks, and screenshots saved under the run artifacts.

## Fail fast

- Command errors fail fast: log the command, return code, stdout and stderr,
  then raise. Never swallow an error or add a fallback path.

## Base freshness

- Every task worktree is created from the frozen `origin/<base_branch>` SHA
  (default `main`), never from the main worktree's current HEAD.
- Branch and worktree names carry the unique run id, so a retried Issue gets
  a new independent run and the old scene is preserved.
- Before creating the PR, re-fetch `origin/<base_branch>`; if the base
  advanced, merge it into the task branch, resolve conflicts manually, rerun
  the full tests and the complete review-fix loop, then push the task branch.
- The runner rejects a delivery whose HEAD does not contain the latest remote
  base. No auto conflict resolution, no force push, no merge or push of the
  protected branch.

## Git

- Work on the task feature branch.
- No merge. No push of `main` or `master`. Deliver through exactly one PR
  linked to the Issue.

## Scope

- No database, queue, daemon loop, risk engine, or fallback. GitHub Issues
  and labels are the only state store.
- No timeout on business tasks. systemd only schedules the tick and owns the
  run lifecycle.
